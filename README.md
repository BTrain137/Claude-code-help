# Claude Code Help

A collection of guides, tools, and workflows for working with Claude Code.

## Guides

- **[Claude Code Statusline Setup](CLAUDE_CODE_STATUSLINE_SETUP.md)** -- Custom statusline showing context window usage, daily token/cost tracking, git branch, and a color-coded progress bar.

## BMAD Workflows

- **[Auto-Sprint](bmad-auto-sprint/)** -- Autonomous sprint loop that cycles through Create Story → Dev Story → Quality Gate → Code Review until scope is complete. Ralph-style YOLO execution with circuit breakers.

## Speckit Workflows
- is a structured ideation-to-implementation pipeline implemented as 15 slash commands for Claude Code. It turns vague feature ideas into formal specs, plans, tasks, and working code.
